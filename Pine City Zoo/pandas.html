                <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native
                    to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its
                    eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to
                    distinguish it from the unrelated red panda.
                <p>
                <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also
                    in neighbouring provinces, namely Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and
                    other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.</p>
                <p>The giant panda is a conservation reliant endangered species.</p>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the pandas at Panda Canyon.</p>
